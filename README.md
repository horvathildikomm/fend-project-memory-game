# Memory Game Project

Thid is a Memory Game for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

## How the Game was created

In this poject I used a starter code what was provided. You can download the starter code through either:

* [the Memory Game project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game)
* [this zipped folder](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game/archive/master.zip)

## How the game is played

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

 * The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
 * The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card   with the same symbol.
 * If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
 * If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
